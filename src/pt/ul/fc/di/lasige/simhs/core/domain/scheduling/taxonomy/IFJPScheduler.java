/**
 * This interface belongs to a set of interfaces serving only the purpose of

 * Implementing this interface does not add to the methods that the class must
 * implement, but rather allows using instanceof to verify properties of the
 * scheduler (e.g., <code>scheduler instanceof IFTPScheduler</code> allows
 * checking if a <code>scheduler</code> is a FTP (fixed task priority, RM-like)
 * scheduler, if such knowledge is needed for schedulability analysis purposes.
