 * This class provides a representation of a scheduling job, as seen in most
 * real-time scheduling theory. Regardless of the task model, a job is an
 * activation of a parent task, with a release time, an execution requirement,
 * and an absolute deadline. It is up to the clients of this class to use the
 * absolute deadline as they see fit for the individual case (hard real-time,
 * soft real-time, etc.), by (for instance) verifying (or not) deadline misses,
 * being lax about deadline fulfilment, or initializing it with
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE.
