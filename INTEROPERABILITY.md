# Interoperability

Third-party tools and formats with which hsSim is compatible

* [Grasp](http://www.win.tue.nl/~mholende/grasp/): Trace visualization toolset developed by Mike Holenderski (TU Eindhoven, Netherlands). hsSim is able to record the events of a simulation in the trace format interpreted by Grasp Player. There has been a great degree of idea exchanges allowing for improvements on both sides, to which we must thank Mike Holdenderski.
